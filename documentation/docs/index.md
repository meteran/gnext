# Intro

gNext is a Golang API-focused framework extending [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). Offers the API
structuring, automates validation and generates documentation. It's compatible with the existing Gin handlers and Gin
middlewares. Designed to simplify and boost development of JSON APIs. You can leave generic and boring stuff to gNext
and purely focus on the business logic.
